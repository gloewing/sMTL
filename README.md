# Multi-Task Learning for Sparsity Pattern Heterogeneity: A Discrete Optimiztion Approach (sMTL)
## Repository Description

Repository for code for R Package `sMTL` under development and for code to run analyses and reproduce figures in the paper.

<br />
<br />

## Folders
1) The 'Package' folder has code for the 'sMTL' R package that is current under development. This includes Julia code to run algorithms and R wrapper code to tune and fit these models. This package is still under development and has not been widely tested.

2) The 'sMTL_Paper' folder has code to run analyses and make figures for the manuscript. Some files will require changing path names. Please feel free to reach out to the author for more annotation or help with reproducing any analyses.
